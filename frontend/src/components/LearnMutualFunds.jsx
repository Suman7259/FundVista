          question: "What is a Mutual Fund?",
          answer: "A mutual fund is a professionally managed investment vehicle that pools money from multiple investors to invest in stocks, bonds, or other securities. It's managed by professional fund managers who make investment decisions on behalf of investors."
        },
        {
          question: "How do Mutual Funds work?",
          answer: "When you invest in a mutual fund, you buy units of the fund. The price of each unit is called NAV (Net Asset Value). As the fund's investments grow, the NAV increases, giving you returns on your investment. Fund managers actively manage the portfolio by buying and selling securities."
        },
        {
          question: "What is NAV (Net Asset Value)?",
          answer: "NAV is the per-unit market value of a mutual fund. It's calculated by dividing the total value of all securities in the portfolio, minus liabilities, by the total number of outstanding units. NAV is updated daily based on the closing market prices."
        },
        {
          question: "Why invest in Mutual Funds?",
          answer: "Mutual funds offer professional management, diversification, liquidity, affordability, and tax benefits. They're ideal for investors who want market exposure without managing individual stocks themselves."

          question: "What is SIP?",
          answer: "SIP is a method of investing a fixed amount regularly (monthly/quarterly) in mutual funds. Instead of investing a lump sum, you invest small amounts consistently over time, making it easier to build wealth gradually."
        },
        {
          question: "Benefits of SIP",
          answer: "1. Rupee Cost Averaging: Buy more units when prices are low and fewer when high\n2. Power of Compounding: Returns generate their own returns over time\n3. Disciplined Investing: Regular investment habit\n4. Affordability: Start with as low as ₹500\n5. Flexibility: Can increase, decrease, or pause anytime"
        },
        {
          question: "How does Rupee Cost Averaging work?",
          answer: "When markets are down, your fixed SIP amount buys more units. When markets are up, it buys fewer units. Over time, this averages out your purchase cost, reducing the impact of market volatility."
        },
        {
          question: "Power of Compounding in SIP",
          answer: "Compounding means earning returns on your returns. For example, investing ₹5,000 monthly for 20 years at 12% returns can grow to over ₹50 lakhs, where you invested only ₹12 lakhs. The remaining ₹38+ lakhs is from compounding!"
        },
        {
          question: "SIP vs Lumpsum",
          answer: "SIP: Regular small investments, reduces market timing risk, better for salaried individuals\nLumpsum: One-time large investment, good when you have surplus funds, higher returns if market timing is right\n\nBest approach: Combine both - SIP for regular income and lumpsum for bonuses/windfalls"

          question: "What is CAGR (Annualized Returns)?",

        },
        {
          question: "What is Expense Ratio?",
          answer: "Expense ratio is the annual fee charged by the fund house for managing your money. It's expressed as a percentage of assets.\n\nExample: 1% expense ratio means ₹100 fee on ₹10,000 investment annually.\n\nLower is better! Index funds typically have 0.1-0.5%, while actively managed funds have 1-2.5%."

        {
          question: "Understanding Risk Levels",

Long-term = can take higher risk."
        },
        {
          question: "What is Standard Deviation?",
          answer: "Standard deviation measures volatility - how much returns fluctuate from average. Higher standard deviation = more volatile fund.\n\nExample: Fund A returns: 10%, 11%, 12% (Low SD - stable)\nFund B returns: 5%, 20%, 8% (High SD - volatile)\n\nIf you're risk-averse, choose funds with lower standard deviation."
